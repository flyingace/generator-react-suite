Use the Yeoman React Suite Component Generator to streamline the process of scaffolding components.

These components include the component itself (JSX), a Sass template, unit tests, and benchmarks.

You can update the `config.json` file to specify a default path for your generated files to go, otherwise you can specify in the generator prompt.

The generator is smart enough to know that string types are contained in single quotes, and boolean values *'t'* and *'f'* will be interpreted as *'true'* and *'false'*. All other values must include syntactically correct code.

Enjoy!
